It aims to provide and centralize open and reusable data on Burundi. It is a work in progress. For the moment, we are making available data from the directories of the Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies of Burundi (ISTEEBU) and soon those of the Bank of the Republic of Burundi (BRB). We wish to offer a free tool at the service of citizens, researchers, NGOs and decision-makers."
